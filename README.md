# NanoWeb Main
## This is the main repository for NanoWeb.

### Installation
    Requirements listed in requirements.txt in main directory.
    This project is ran using python 3.10 in a local installation or virtual environment.

    1. Run pip -r requirements.txt in a terminal window.
    2. In a terminal window, type "streamlit run NanoPrepare.py".
    3. NanoWeb should open in your default browser.
### Uninstallation
    Delete the SH32 main directory in your filesystem.
### File input
    Accepted files are currently zip directories of any number of .txt experiments
    For instance an optics11 d mode zipped ddirectory containing one file, 
    a ".txt" file, with relevant header to the filetype followed by data.
### JSON output
    The JSON export function saves the data of active curves loaded into NanoWeb Prepare in a generalised format to a JSON file. In order to save this file, first click the "save to json" button, then the "download JSON file" button that pops up below the first button. File test.json will be downloaded to your chosen folder, and can be renamed locally. 
### Features of NanoWeb Prepare 

	Users can apply filters from a drop down menu on the bottom left. Force threshold filter is implemented and correctly generates a list of curves that pass the threshold. The backend of filters is easily extendable, and in the future a new filter can be added by creating a concrete subclass of the Filter abstract.  

	Users can crop the range of displacement shown with the sliders on the right.
    
    Users can zoom into and hover over a datapoint to read the Force, Displacement and experiment file location of said datapoint.

	Users can export to JSON for use in NanoWeb Analysis or similar.
### Known issues in NanoWeb Prepare

    Tooltip hitboxes are too small, making it difficult to hover over a datapoint.

    Zooming in and out is not smooth.
### Features of NanoWeb Analysis

    Users can upload a JSON file from NanoWeb Prepare or similar.

    Users can select a file from the JSON file to view, or disable files to remove them from the plots. 

    Users can select a range of files from the JSON file to view.
### Known issues in NanoWeb Analysis

    Usability is poor.
    
    Loading time is poor for json files which contain a large number of experiments. This is due to Streamlit's built-in functionality such that any change to the state of GUI elements cause the entire code to re-run. (Note: Streamlit's developers shared in December 2022 that they are working on ways to disable re-running for certain elements/widgets, and therefore it will be possible to improve this greatly in the future.)

    Analysis tools are not implemented.

    Exporting a process log is not implemented.
